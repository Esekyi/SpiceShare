## Introduction📖

SpiceShare was born from the love for food and the desire to build a community where people can discover new flavors and culinary traditions. The idea started from noticing how food often brings people together, regardless of culture or background. SpiceShare aims to create that sense of togetherness online by making it easy for users to upload and share their favorite recipes.

### Challenges and Vision🚧
While developing this project, I encountered challenges with implementing image uploads for recipes, building robust user authentication, and managing dynamic ingredient lists. These hurdles taught me to think critically and apply solutions like modular architecture and database management. Looking forward, I envision further features like AI-based recipe recommendations and a mobile app version.

## Core Features🧩

- User authentication
- Recipe creation and sharing
- Search and filter recipes
- User profiles
- Favorite and save recipes (later updates)

## Prerequisites🎯
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)

--- this is only used to build tailwind css
