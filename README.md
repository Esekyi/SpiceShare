## Introductionüìñ

SpiceShare was born from the love for food and the desire to build a community where people can discover new flavors and culinary traditions. The idea started from noticing how food often brings people together, regardless of culture or background. SpiceShare aims to create that sense of togetherness online by making it easy for users to upload and share their favorite recipes.

### Challenges and Visionüöß
While developing this project, I encountered challenges with implementing image uploads for recipes, building robust user authentication, and managing dynamic ingredient lists. These hurdles taught me to think critically and apply solutions like modular architecture and database management. Looking forward, I envision further features like AI-based recipe recommendations and a mobile app version.

## Core Featuresüß©

- User authentication
- Recipe creation and sharing
- Search and filter recipes
- User profiles
- Favorite and save recipes (later updates)

## PrerequisitesüéØ
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)

--- this is only used to build tailwind css

## Installation‚öôÔ∏è

To run SpiceShare locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
    https://github.com/Esekyi/SpiceShare.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
	```
	cd spiceshare
	```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
	```
	python -m venv .venv
	source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
	```

4. Create a .env file in the root directory and add these variables
	```
	S3_BUCKET_NAME='AWS_S3_bucketName' # for uploads to AWS S3, add your bucket name here
	AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='' # AWS Access key
	AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='' # AWS secrete key
	AWS_REGION='' # AWS region for the S3

	DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres:localhost' # Postgress db url
	SECRET_KEY='WQioiUU-TWIQ-To-Much_TO-6ue22' # Secrete key for Flask and Flsk-WTF

	# Flask-mail variables
	MAIL_SERVER ='smtp.gmail.com'  # SMTP server address
	MAIL_PORT =587  # Usually, 465 for SSL or 587 for TLS
	MAIL_USE_TLS =True  # If you are using port 587 (for TLS), set to True
	MAIL_USERNAME =''  # Your email address
	MAIL_PASSWORD =''  # Your email password
	MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER ='Your name <your_name@example.com>'
	```

5. Install dependencies:
